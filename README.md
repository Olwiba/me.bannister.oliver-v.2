# Digital Portfolio
## Oliver.Bannister.me
### What am I looking at?

This is a place for me to store all the source code for my digital portfolio. 
This is the code that will be compiled and served on [my personal site](https://oliver.bannister.me).

### What is this for? 

This project is to give me a place to showcase my work and also tell people a little about myself.
I also want to use this oppotunity to reenforce my knowlage on the technologies that interest me.

A also want this as a place for potential employers to be able to see under the hood of my personal site, I will outline the technologies that I have used for this project and even comment my major learnings / Blocks that I came across with this project.

### Aim

At this time im planning to try and keep my site simple but beautiful and after I have hit MVP I will start to impliment other features that I want.

This is a work in progress so until a stable release is out I won't be uploading this to the server.

## Technologies Used

__..To be added as I use them..__

## Learnings / Blocks / Gotchas

__..To be added as I come accross them..__

__Note:__ Feel free to use code that I have written, But please don't just steal the whole site and claim it as your own... Thats a dick move. Are you a dick?
